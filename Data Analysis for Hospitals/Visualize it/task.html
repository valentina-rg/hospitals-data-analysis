<p>Are you ready to catch sight of your data?</p>
<p>Graphics are arguably the most accessible way to represent the data and its structure. Sometimes, it can help to find the main data patterns and deviations. We will use data visualization methods to conclude our dataset.</p>
<p>In the last stage, you need to create data visualization to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the most common age of a patient among all hospitals? Plot a histogram and choose one of the following age ranges: 0-15, 15-35, 35-55, 55-70, or 70-80.</li>
<li>What is the most common diagnosis among patients in all hospitals? Create a pie chart.</li>
<li>Build a violin plot of height distribution by hospitals. Try to answer the questions. What is the main reason for the gap in values? Why there are two peaks, which correspond to the relatively small and big values? No special form is required to answer this question.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Tip:</b> To answer the last question think about specializations of the hospitals in the dataset and the unit of measurement of height.</p>
<p>Please note that the answers are independent of each other.</p>
<p>At this stage, use <code class="java">pandas</code> visualization tools, <code class="java">seaborn</code> or <code class="java">matplotlib</code>. For second plot use <code class="java">pandas</code> or <code class="java">matplotlib</code>, this is necessary for the tests to run correctly.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Use the DataFrame from the previous stage. The fifth stage requires completing one step:</p>
<p>Answer questions 1-3. Output the answers in the specified format. The answers to the first two questions should be formatted as in the examples. No special form is required to answer the third question</p>
<p>If you have corrupted CSV files, please <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/467509/files.zip" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download them</a> and unzip in your working directory.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The input is 3 CSV files, <code class="java">test/general.csv</code>, <code class="java">test/prenatal.csv</code>, and <code class="java">test/sports.csv</code>.</p>
<p>The output:<br/>
